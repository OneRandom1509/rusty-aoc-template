# Rusty AOC Template

Be lazy.

# Get started

- Clone the repo, ensure you have Rust and cargo installed :sob:
- Run `autogen.sh` with the day `n` as the input
- Put the day's input in `src/inputs/day{n}-input.txt`
- Code in `src/days/day{n}.rs` for that day's part 1 and/or part 2 problem
- In the project's root, run the command `cargo run <day_number> <part_number>`
