# Rusty AOC Template

Be lazy.

## Get started

- Clone the repo, ensure you have Rust and cargo installed :sob:
- `export COOKIE=<session_cookie>` in your shell to automatically fetch the inputs. If not set, the script will generate empty input files
- Run `autogen.sh`
  - Enter the day number
- Code in `src/days/day{n}.rs` for that day's part 1 and/or part 2 problem
- In the project's root, run the command `cargo run <day_number> <part_number>`

## To do

- Let the user set the year
